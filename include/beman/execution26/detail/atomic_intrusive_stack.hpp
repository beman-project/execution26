//! @brief  This data structure is an intrusive stack that can be used in a lock-free manner.
//!
//! The stack is implemented as a singly linked list where the head is an atomic pointer to the first item in
//! the stack.
//! try_push() is a lock-free operation that tries to push an item to the stack. If the stack is empty, it
//! returns nullptr and the item is pushed to the stack.
//! This stack has a closed state, which is indicated by the head pointing to the stack itself. In this state,
//! try_push() returns std::nullopt and the stack is not modified.
//! pop_all_and_shutdown() is a lock-free operation that pops all items from the stack and returns them in a
//! queue. If the stack is empty, it returns an empty queue.
//!
//! We use this stack in the split implementation to store the listeners that are waiting for the operation to
//! complete.
//!
//! @tparam Item  The type of the item in the stack.
//! @tparam Next  The pointer to the next item in the stack.
